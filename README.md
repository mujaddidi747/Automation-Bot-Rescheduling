Customizable Rules: Users can define the criteria for rescheduling, such as availability, car type, or inspection type.
Error Handling: Handles errors gracefully, such as unavailability of slots or system downtimes, with appropriate notifications.
Logging: Detailed logs are maintained for all bot activities, allowing for transparency and auditing.
